<!-- WHO WE ARE -->
<section>
  <h2>Who We Are</h2>

  <div class="card">
    <p>
      <strong>Seraphis IT and Data Solutions (Pty) Ltd</strong> is a South Africa–based
      cybersecurity firm delivering enterprise-grade security, risk, and compliance
      services to organisations operating in highly regulated and high-risk environments.
    </p>

    <p>
      We support enterprises, critical infrastructure operators, and public-sector
      organisations across Africa and internationally — providing security capabilities
      that are resilient, measurable, and aligned to global best practices.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our approach is <strong>architecture-led</strong>, <strong>platform-native</strong>,
      and <strong>outcome-driven</strong>. We do not sell tools in isolation.
      We design, operate, and govern security as a business capability.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- MISSION & VISION -->
<section>
  <h2>Mission & Vision</h2>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>
      To secure enterprises, governments, and critical infrastructure against evolving
      cyber threats by delivering resilient, compliant, and intelligence-driven security
      solutions built on Microsoft platforms and global best practices.
    </p>

    <h3>Our Vision</h3>
    <p>
      To become a trusted global cybersecurity partner emerging from Africa —
      recognised for safeguarding digital trust, operational continuity,
      and national economic resilience.
    </p>
  </div>

<!-- PRINCIPLES -->
<section>
  <h2>Our Operating Principles</h2>

  <div class="card">
    <div class="principle">
      <strong>Security is a business risk</strong><br>
      Cybersecurity decisions must support operational continuity, compliance,
      and strategic objectives.
    </div>

    <div class="principle">
      <strong>Outcomes over tools</strong><br>
      We measure success through reduced risk, faster detection, and improved resilience —
      not product deployment.
    </div>

    <div class="principle">
      <strong>Ethics and confidentiality</strong><br>
      Trust is foundational. We operate with strict confidentiality,
      professionalism, and regulatory awareness.
    </div>

    <div class="principle">
      <strong>Resilience by design</strong><br>
      Security must assume failure and focus on detection,
      response, and recovery.
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- TEAM -->
<section>
  <h2>Our Multi-Disciplinary Team</h2>

  <div class="card">
    <p>
      Seraphis brings together practitioners across the cybersecurity lifecycle,
      enabling integrated delivery rather than siloed services.
    </p>

      <li>Governance, risk & compliance specialists</li>

      <li>Incident responders and forensic analysts</li>
    </ul>

    <p>

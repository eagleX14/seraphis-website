<!-- INTRO -->

    Technology alone does not prevent breaches. Most successful cyber incidents
    exploit human behaviour, unclear decision-making, and untested response processes.

    Seraphis delivers <strong>role-based, outcome-driven cybersecurity training</strong>
    designed to reduce risk exposure, improve executive confidence, and meet
    regulatory expectations — aligned to real attack patterns observed in
    South Africa, Africa, and globally.
